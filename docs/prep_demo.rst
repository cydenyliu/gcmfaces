Tutorial Examples
=================

To proceed with the tutorial examples, user is expected to have completed the software 
installation and data downloads from :numref:`install` (including  
``nctiles_climatology/`` and ``m_map/``). The full suite of tutorial examples
can then be executed via ``gcmfaces_demo.m`` by opening Matlab and typing

::

    p = genpath('gcmfaces/'); addpath(p);
    p = genpath('m_map/'); addpath(p);
    gcmfaces_demo;

As prompted by ``gcmfaces_demo.m``, specify the desired amount of explanatory 
text output. Various examples then proceed and display comments in
the Matlab or Octave command window. The Matlab GUI and debugger can also 
be used to run each example line by line. This can be useful to learn more 
about the inner workings of `gcmfaces` functions.

The first section in ``gcmfaces_demo.m`` illustrates I/O and plotting
capabilities (``grid_load.m`` and ``example_display.m``). The second
section focuses on data processing capabilities such
as interpolation and smoothing.
``example_interp.m`` interpolates fields to a lat-lon grid and vice versa.
``example_smooth.m`` integrates a diffusion equation which involves tracer
gradient and flux convergence computations. The final section in
``gcmfaces_demo.m`` computes oceanic transports (``example_transports.m``).

   Same as :numref:`plot_one_field_FACES` but
   plotted in geographical coordinates using ``m_map_gcmfaces.m``. This plot
   is generated by calling example_display(4).
